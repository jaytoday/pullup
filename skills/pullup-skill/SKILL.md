**IMPORTANT - Path Resolution:**
This skill can be installed in different locations. Before executing commands, determine the skill directory based on where you loaded this SKILL.md file, and use that path in all commands below. Replace `$SKILL_DIR` with the actual discovered path.

Common installation paths:
- Plugin system: `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/pullup/skills/pullup-skill`
- Manual global: `~/.claude/skills/pullup-skill`
- Project-specific: `<project>/.claude/skills/pullup-skill`

# PullUp - Application Testing Skill Generator

A meta-skill that creates application-specific testing skills by exploring web applications and capturing their structure, features, and test patterns.

## What It Does

PullUp solves the problem of repeatedly providing application details every time you want to test a specific web app. Instead:

1. **One-time exploration**: PullUp explores your web application once
2. **Knowledge capture**: Maps pages, forms, navigation, and interactive elements
3. **Skill generation**: Creates a custom testing skill with all this knowledge
4. **Easy testing**: Use the generated skill for quick, context-aware testing

## How It Works

1. You provide: Application URL, name, and optional feature documentation
2. PullUp explores the application using browser automation
3. Generates a custom skill with application knowledge
4. You can now test the app without re-explaining its structure

## Setup (First Time)

```bash
cd $SKILL_DIR
npm run setup
```

This installs Playwright and Chromium browser. Only needed once.

## Usage

### Recommended: Use Documentation Files

The easiest way to use PullUp is to provide your existing project documentation. PullUp automatically extracts URLs, credentials, pages, features, and more.

**From a single file:**
```
"Use PullUp to create a testing skill from README.md for myapp"
```

**From a documentation folder:**
```
"Create testing skill for myapp using docs from ./project-docs folder"
```

**With guidance:**
```
"Create testing skill for myapp from ./docs folder.
Focus on the admin features - they're the most important to test."
```

### What Documentation to Provide

Any text or markdown files work. PullUp extracts useful information automatically:

Create a file like `myapp-info.md`:

```markdown
# MyApp Documentation

Runs at: http://localhost:3000

## Features
- Login page: /login
- Dashboard: /dashboard
- Settings: /settings

## Test Account
Email: test@example.com
Password: testpass123
```

Then:
```
"Use PullUp to create a testing skill from myapp-info.md for myapp"
```

**Or use a documentation folder:**
```
"Create testing skill for myapp using docs from ./project-docs folder"
```

PullUp reads all `.txt`, `.md`, and `.markdown` files recursively and extracts:
- ‚úÖ Application URLs (http://localhost:3000, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Page paths (/login, /dashboard, /products, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Credentials (test emails and passwords)
- ‚úÖ Feature descriptions (from headings, bullet points)
- ‚úÖ Important notes and context

### Alternative: Just URL

If you don't have documentation handy:

```
"Create a testing skill for my app at http://localhost:3000 called 'myapp'"
```

### Update an Existing Skill

When your application changes:

```
"Update the mystore testing skill"
```

PullUp will re-explore and merge new findings with existing knowledge.

## Execution Pattern

**Step 1: Provide documentation or URL**

```bash
# With documentation (recommended)
cd $SKILL_DIR && node execute.js --name myapp --docs ./README.md

# With documentation folder
cd $SKILL_DIR && node execute.js --name myapp --docs ./docs

# With guidance
cd $SKILL_DIR && node execute.js --name myapp --docs ./docs \
  --prompt "Focus on admin features"

# Just URL
cd $SKILL_DIR && node execute.js --name myapp --url http://localhost:3000

# Update existing skill
cd $SKILL_DIR && node execute.js --name myapp --update
```

**Step 2: PullUp explores and generates**

PullUp will:
1. Read documentation (if provided) to extract context
2. Explore your application with Playwright
3. Discover pages, forms, and interactive elements
4. Generate a complete testing skill

**Step 3: Use the generated skill**

```
"Use myapp-testing to verify the homepage loads"
"Test login with myapp-testing skill"
```

## Generated Skill Structure

PullUp creates a new skill directory:

```
~/.claude/skills/mystore-testing/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md               # Generated skill definition
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app-knowledge.json     # Application structure map
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-patterns.js       # Common test helpers
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # Usage instructions
```

## What Gets Discovered

During exploration, PullUp identifies:

### Pages
- All accessible URLs
- Page titles and purposes
- Navigation structure
- Page types (form, list, detail, etc.)

### Forms
- Input fields with names and types
- Buttons and submit actions
- Validation requirements
- Expected outcomes

### Interactive Elements
- Buttons and their actions
- Links and navigation
- Modals and popups
- Dynamic content areas

### User Flows
- Login/logout patterns
- Multi-step processes (signup, checkout, etc.)
- Navigation paths between pages
- Common user journeys

## Exploration Strategy

PullUp uses intelligent exploration:

1. **Starting Point**: Begins at provided URL
2. **Crawling**: Follows internal links (same domain)
3. **Depth Limit**: Configurable max depth (default: 3 levels)
4. **Rate Limiting**: Respects server load
5. **Authentication**: Tests auth flows if credentials provided
6. **Screenshots**: Captures key pages for reference

## Configuration Options

Control exploration behavior:

```json
{
  "exploration": {
    "maxDepth": 3,
    "maxPages": 50,
    "timeout": 30000,
    "waitForNetworkIdle": true,
    "followExternalLinks": false
  },
  "analysis": {
    "detectFramework": true,
    "captureScreenshots": true,
    "analyzeAccessibility": false
  }
}
```

## Using Generated Skills

Once created, use generated skills naturally:

```
"Use mystore-testing skill to verify the checkout flow"
"Test login using mystore-testing skill"
"Check if product search works in mystore"
```

The generated skill already knows:
- Application URL
- Page structure
- Element selectors
- Expected workflows
- Test credentials (if provided)

## Skill Composability

Generated skills reference the base Playwright skill:
- Don't duplicate execution logic
- Focus on application knowledge
- Leverage Playwright's full capabilities
- Can specify extensions to include

## Extension System

Extend PullUp with specialized analyzers:

### Security Extension
Adds security testing patterns:
- XSS vulnerability checks
- SQL injection tests
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Security header verification

### Accessibility Extension
Adds accessibility testing:
- ARIA label verification
- Keyboard navigation tests
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast checks

### Performance Extension
Adds performance benchmarks:
- Page load timing
- Resource size analysis
- Rendering performance
- Network request optimization

### Using Extensions

```
"Create a testing skill with security extension"
"Use PullUp with accessibility and performance extensions"
```

Extensions are npm packages: `pullup-extension-security`, `pullup-extension-accessibility`, etc.

## Tips

- **Provide credentials**: Better exploration of authenticated areas
- **Document features**: Help PullUp understand application purpose
- **Update regularly**: Re-run PullUp when application changes significantly
- **Review generated skill**: Check app-knowledge.json for accuracy
- **Customize**: Edit generated test-patterns.js for specific needs

## Troubleshooting

**Skill generation fails:**
```bash
cd $SKILL_DIR && npm run setup
```

**Can't access authenticated pages:**
Provide credentials in documentation files or via --prompt argument

**Too many pages discovered:**
Adjust with --max-pages and --max-depth command-line options

**Missing important pages:**
Add them to your documentation files or use --prompt to specify them

## Example Workflow

**Initial Setup:**
```
User: "Create a testing skill for my app at localhost:3000 called todoapp"

Claude: I'll explore your application and create a testing skill.
[Runs PullUp skill]
[Explores 8 pages, finds 3 forms, identifies 2 user flows]

Created 'todoapp-testing' skill at ~/.claude/skills/todoapp-testing/

Discovered:
- Login page at /login
- Todo list at /todos
- Add todo form
- Edit todo functionality
- Delete todo action

You can now use: "Test the todo creation flow using todoapp-testing"
```

**Using Generated Skill:**
```
User: "Use todoapp-testing to verify login works"

Claude: I'll test login for todoapp.
[Uses todoapp-testing skill - already knows URL, selectors, credentials]
[References base Playwright skill for execution]

Login test passed ‚úÖ
- Navigated to http://localhost:3000/login
- Filled email: test@example.com
- Filled password: [hidden]
- Successfully redirected to /todos
```

**Updating After Changes:**
```
User: "We added a calendar view, update todoapp-testing skill"

Claude: I'll update the skill by re-exploring todoapp.
[Runs PullUp with --update flag]
[Discovers new /calendar page]
[Merges with existing knowledge]

Updated todoapp-testing skill:
- Added /calendar page
- Found new calendar navigation button
- Updated navigation structure
- Preserved your custom patterns
```

## Command Reference

```bash
# Recommended: With documentation
node execute.js --name <appname> --docs <file-or-folder>

# With guidance prompt
node execute.js --name <appname> --docs ./docs --prompt "Focus on X feature"

# Just URL
node execute.js --name <appname> --url <url>

# Update existing skill
node execute.js --name <appname> --update

# Custom output directory
node execute.js --name <appname> --docs ./docs --output ~/.claude/skills/

# Custom exploration settings
node execute.js --name <appname> --docs ./docs --max-depth 5 --max-pages 100

# Verbose output
node execute.js --name <appname> --docs ./docs --verbose
```

## Notes

- PullUp is a meta-skill that creates other skills
- Generated skills are self-contained and reusable
- Skills can be shared with team members
- Regular updates keep skills in sync with application changes
- Extensions enable specialized testing without modifying core PullUp
- Works best with modern web applications (SPAs, progressive web apps)
